This code builds the convex hull of a set of 2D points.

A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon (polygon where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees) that can enclose a set of points in a 2D plane.

The code implements a convex hull algorithm using a recursive divide-and-conquer approach.
